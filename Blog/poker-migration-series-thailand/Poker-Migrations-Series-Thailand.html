        <span class="span-1">Cost of living:</span><br />
        Whether you're planning an extended holiday or pondering a digital nomad
        lifestyle, Phuket emerges as an excellent choice. Known for its
        awe-inspiring beaches, friendly locals, and cost-effective living
        expenses, the island offers a wide range of housing options. The cost of
        accommodation can significantly vary based on location, type of
        property, and season. Here's what you might expect to pay for housing on
        a monthly basis:

      <div class="p-4">
        <h4 class="hotels">Hotels:</h4>
        <p>
          Extended stays at hotels in Phuket are certainly viable. A basic hotel
          room could cost between 15,000 to 25,000 baht per month ($450 - $750).
          For mid-range hotels, expect to pay between 25,000 to 50,000 baht per
          month ($750 - $1,500). Luxury hotels and resorts, however, may exceed
          100,000 baht ($3,000) or more per month.
        </p>
        <h4>Serviced Apartments:</h4>
        <p>
          Serviced apartments are a popular choice for long stays, offering
          extras like cleaning services, utilities, and access to amenities such
          as a gym or pool. A standard serviced apartment might cost around
          10,000 to 20,000 baht per month ($300 - $600), while high-end options
          can range from 30,000 to 60,000 baht ($900 - $1,800) or more per
          month.
        </p>
        <h4>Airbnb:</h4>
        <p>
          Airbnb rentals can vary widely in cost. A private room may start from
          around 7,000 baht ($210) per month. If you prefer a place all to
          yourself, prices generally start at around 15,000 baht ($450) for a
          simple apartment. For a luxurious villa complete with a private pool
          and other amenities, you might need to budget upwards of 60,000 baht
          ($1,800) per month.
        </p>
        <h4>Rental Apartments and Houses:</h4>
        <p>
          If you're planning a long-term stay in Phuket, renting an apartment or
          house may be the most cost-effective option. A basic one-bedroom
          apartment in a less tourist-centric area could cost around 8,000 to
          15,000 baht per month ($240 - $450). In contrast, a similar apartment
          in a more bustling area like Patong could range between 15,000 to
          30,000 baht ($450 - $900). Standalone houses or villas could start
          from around 20,000 baht ($600) and escalate to 100,000 baht ($3,000)
          or more for luxury options.
        </p>
