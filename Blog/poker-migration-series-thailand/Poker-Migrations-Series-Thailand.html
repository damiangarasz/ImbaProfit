      </p>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <h3>Cost of living:</h3>
      <p>
        Whether you're planning an extended holiday or pondering a digital nomad
        lifestyle, Phuket emerges as an excellent choice. Known for its
        awe-inspiring beaches, friendly locals, and cost-effective living
        expenses, the island offers a wide range of housing options. The cost of
        accommodation can significantly vary based on location, type of
        property, and season. Here's what you might expect to pay for housing on
        a monthly basis:
      </p>
      <h4>Hotels:</h4>
      <p>
        Extended stays at hotels in Phuket are certainly viable. A basic hotel
        room could cost between 15,000 to 25,000 baht per month ($450 - $750).
        For mid-range hotels, expect to pay between 25,000 to 50,000 baht per
        month ($750 - $1,500). Luxury hotels and resorts, however, may exceed
        100,000 baht ($3,000) or more per month.
      </p>
      <h4>Serviced Apartments:</h4>
      <p>
        Serviced apartments are a popular choice for long stays, offering extras
        like cleaning services, utilities, and access to amenities such as a gym
        or pool. A standard serviced apartment might cost around 10,000 to
        20,000 baht per month ($300 - $600), while high-end options can range
        from 30,000 to 60,000 baht ($900 - $1,800) or more per month.
      </p>
      <h4>Airbnb:</h4>
      <p>
        Airbnb rentals can vary widely in cost. A private room may start from
        around 7,000 baht ($210) per month. If you prefer a place all to
        yourself, prices generally start at around 15,000 baht ($450) for a
        simple apartment. For a luxurious villa complete with a private pool and
        other amenities, you might need to budget upwards of 60,000 baht
        ($1,800) per month.
      </p>
      <h4>Rental Apartments and Houses:</h4>
      <p>
        If you're planning a long-term stay in Phuket, renting an apartment or
        house may be the most cost-effective option. A basic one-bedroom
        apartment in a less tourist-centric area could cost around 8,000 to
        15,000 baht per month ($240 - $450). In contrast, a similar apartment in
        a more bustling area like Patong could range between 15,000 to 30,000
        baht ($450 - $900). Standalone houses or villas could start from around
        20,000 baht ($600) and escalate to 100,000 baht ($3,000) or more for
        luxury options.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note, these prices are estimations and can fluctuate based on
        location, season, and the amenities provided. Always remember to check
        multiple sources, read reviews, and negotiate when possible to secure
        the best deal.

      <h4>Phuket's Guide to Grocery Prices for Visitors</h4>
      <p>
        Known not only for its magnificent beaches, Phuket is also renowned for
        its affordable prices. However, it's essential to understand that
        grocery costs can greatly vary depending on whether you're shopping in a
        tourist district or a local supermarket. Here's a guide to grocery
        prices in Phuket to help you plan your budget:
      </p>
      <h4>Restaurants and Street Food Stalls:</h4>
      <p>
        Phuket offers an abundant selection of dining options, from upscale
        restaurants serving international cuisine to street food stalls dishing
        out local favorites. A meal at a mid-range restaurant costs around
        200-500 baht ($6 to $15), while a meal at a street food stall typically
        ranges between 50 and 100 baht ($1.5 to $3).
      </p>
      <h4>Supermarkets:</h4>
      <p>
        You can find a vast range of groceries at Phuket's supermarkets and
        grocery stores. Here are some sample prices (in baht):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bread (500g) - around 40-60</li>
        <li>Milk (1l) - around 40-50</li>
        <li>Eggs (12 units) - around 40-50</li>
        <li>Cheese (500g) - around 150-300</li>
        <li>Apples (1kg) - around 60-100</li>
        <li>Bottle of water (1.5l) - around 15-20</li>
        <li>Local beer (0.5l) - around 40-60</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Local markets often offer lower prices than supermarkets, especially for
        fresh fruits, vegetables, and seafood. Remember, though, haggling is
        common practice here and is often expected.
      </p>
      <h4>Alcohol:</h4>
      <p>
        Much like many places worldwide, alcohol is generally more expensive in
        bars and restaurants. A bottle of local beer in a bar costs around
        60-100 baht ($2 to $3), while a bottle of imported beer costs between
        100 and 180 baht ($3 to $5.5). Cocktails are usually more expensive,
        with prices starting from around 150 baht ($4.5).
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, Phuket caters to a range of food preferences and budgets.
        Local cuisine is typically inexpensive and flavorful, and grocery stores
        are well-stocked for those who prefer to cook at home. Please bear in
        mind, these prices are approximate and may vary depending on the season
        and location.
